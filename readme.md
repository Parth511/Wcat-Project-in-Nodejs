# Wcat ðŸš€ðŸš€

This command is used to display or make a copy of content of one or more files in the terminal


## Commands:

1- wcat "filePath" =>displays content od the file in the terminal

2- wcat "filePath1" "filePath2" "filePath3"... =>displays the content of all of the listed files in the wcat command in concatenated form in the given order.

3- wcat -s "filePath" => converts multiple empty lines (big line-breaks) into a singular linebreak.

4- wcat -n "filePath" => gives numberings to allt he existing lines in the listed files' content from the command line.

5- wcat -b "filePath" => gives numbering to only non- empty lines in the content of files listed in the wcat command.

6- wcat "file1Path" > "file2Path"   => adds all the content of file1 into file2 by overriding the original data in file2, if file2 doesn't exist it creates file2 and adds content from file1 into file2

7- wcat "file1Path" >> "file2Path"  => appends all the content frmo file1 into file2. 

8- node wcat -s "filePath1" > "filePath2" => get the file content of filename, remove large spaces and saves the output in filename2

9- we can also mix and mathc the options

### Note - 6, 7 and 8 are Operating System features in CLI terminal.


## Corner Cases
1- If file entered is not found then it gives file does not exist error message

2- -n and -b are mutually exclusive options, so if user types both of them together it should give an error instead of executing both.
